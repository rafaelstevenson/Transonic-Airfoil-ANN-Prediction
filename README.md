# Transonic-Airfoil-ANN-Prediction
An artificial neural network being modeled to predict the aerodynamic coefficients of an airfoil 
that flies at a nominal condition of Mach Number M = 0.729 where the data of varying M and angle of attack Î± results 
in various lift coefficient Cl, drag coefficient Cd and the pressure coefficient at the center of the upper surface of the airfoil Cp using Tensorflow and Keras.

The data were taken from the following reference: 
Pramudita Satria Palar, Lavi Rizki Zuhal, and Koji Shimoyama.
"Gaussian Process Surrogate Model with Composite Kernel Learning for Engineering Design." 
AIAA Journal 58, no. 4 (2020):1864-1880.

The required packages is in the requirements.txt, use pip install -r requirements.txt to install the packages.
Notebook made to explore simple Artificial Neural Network.
